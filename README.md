# Google Maps Webscrapping
Google Maps, not only is a great platform used for navigation and mapping, but also is an important place to retrieve businesses specific to a place / region.

In this project, I am extracting businesses dealing with Hospitality industry around Nairobi, Kenya. The information retrieved is the website url, the name of hotel, contact info, etc.

I utilized Nodejs and Nodejs libraries such as Puppeteer to mine the data. As search keywords usually return out-of-place data, such as those not within the geographical jurisdiction, I had to build a filter algorithm to only leave those data that met the set criteria.
